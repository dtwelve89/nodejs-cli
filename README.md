## NodeCLI Coding Challenge by Danny Nguyen

### Summary:

A modern twist on the classic Unix list(ls) command developed in NodeJS.

The client is able to run the `ls` command in their CLI to show all files/folders in the current directory. Additionally, running the `ls -R` will show all files/folders in the current directory and subdirectories as well.

An error will prompt if an invalid command is entered.

### Technologies Used:

JavaScript, NodeJS

### Run Instructions:

- Clone repository from GitHub

Run commands:

- `node . ls` - show all files/folders in the current directory
- `node . ls -R`- show all files/folders in the current directory and subdirectories
